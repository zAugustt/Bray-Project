TODO:

Investigate necessary components as we repurpose the legacy components for our implementation.

Backend: 

docker exec -it bray-project-backend-1 python /app/db_connector/data_gen.py

* Fixing garbage alembic versions 

Delete all versions in alembic

docker exec -it bray-project-backend-1 alembic revision --autogenerate -m "Initial migration"

docker exec -it bray-project-backend-1 alembic upgrade head

docker exec -it bray-project-db-1 psql -U bray_tamu -d sensor_info_db -h db -p 5432

This includes:
    - Models
    - Queries
    - API connections
    - Dockerfiles
This should not include:
    - MQTT client
    - Flask base

Frontend:

Not necessary to currently investigate implementation until backend support is repurposed.
Ideally, update the design and functionality to best display our project

NOTE: The web app is not something desired by our Industry Sponsor (Bray) therefore all work done can be unique to our specific implementation to best present our project
