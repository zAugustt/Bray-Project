# README
Alembic provides change management for our relational database.

## For Developers
If changes are made to the [models](../db_connector/models.py), then a migration should be created with
```bash
# In backend docker container
alembic revision --autogenerate -m "my migration message" 
```

The autogenerated file may need to be edited. For example, providing default values for non-nullable columns. \
These changes to the schema will then need to be pushed to the database, which is accomplished by
```bash
# In backend docker container
alembic upgrade head
```

## Default Alembic README
Generic single-database configuration.
