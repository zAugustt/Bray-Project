# Team Agreement
* The Bray-dy Bunch
* 1/27/2025

## Team Goals and Objectives
* Be proud of the work we present.

* Complete the given requirements of the project:
  - Implement the new hardware and firmware such that sensor data can be read and transmitted to the web server via LoRa protocols.
  - Update web-application and database structure to display new sensor data along with modifiying the previous implementation.
  - Our reach goal is integrate the last semester's work with our own and send two separate sensor data channels.

* Design a project that results in a professional working demo (e.g. When CO2 is applied to the sensor the system will react).
  - Our project needs to follow our definition of success as outlined in our project report. It is necessary that there are three seperate working subsections these will be the sensor system, transmissions system, and the web-application. Along with this, the full system implementation needs to be completed with the workflow being as follows 

  - **collect sensor data → transmit data via LoRaWAN → visualize data on a web app.**

* Be available, not only for working sessions but for communication between team members.
